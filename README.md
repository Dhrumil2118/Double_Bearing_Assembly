# Double_Bearing_Assembly
Double Bearing model created in SolidWorks with exploded view animation and renders.
🔩 Double Bearing Assembly – SolidWorks Project
This project features a complete Double Bearing Assembly modeled in SolidWorks, including all 3D part files, the main assembly, rendered images, and an animation video showing an exploded view.

Note: Technical drawings are not included in this version.

📁 Folder Structure:
Parts/ – All individual bearing components (.SLDPRT)

Assembly/ – The assembled bearing in SolidWorks (.SLDASM)

Renders/ – Rendered images of the model and exploded view

Animation/ – MP4 animation of the exploded view or rotation

🧩 Components Modeled:
Inner Races (2x)

Outer Races (2x)

Ball Bearings

Cage

Shaft (if applicable)

Bearing Housing (optional)

⚙️ Assembly Details:
All components mated using proper concentric, coincident, and distance mates

Accurate bearing structure and spacing maintained

Simulated real-world assembly configuration

🎥 Exploded View & Animation:
Created using SolidWorks Motion Study

Displays the separation and alignment of each part

Useful for visual understanding of bearing structure
